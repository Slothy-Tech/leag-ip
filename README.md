<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Research suggests that bypassing an IP ban in League of Legends requires a combination of changing your IP address, clearing stored data, reinstalling the game, and adjusting your MAC address if needed.</li>
    <li>These steps are designed to work together, addressing both network-level bans and local device identifiers.</li>
    <li>The evidence leans toward this multi-step approach being thorough and effective for PC players who are banned from playing or accessing League of Legends services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Method: Mandatory Steps to Bypass IP Bans</h2>
<p>To bypass a League of Legends IP ban, follow these steps in order. Each step builds on the previous one to ensure the ban is fully circumvented.</p>

<h3>1. Changing Your IP Address</h3>
<p>The first step is to change your IP address, which is the core of bypassing an IP ban. This makes it appear as if you’re accessing League of Legends from a different location. You can use a VPN, proxy server, or switch network connections.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For PC:</strong> Download a <a href="https://slothytech.com/ip-ban/">reputable VPN service</a>, install it, select a server in a different region, and connect. Launch League of Legends with the new IP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Using a Proxy Server:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For PC:</strong> Find a <a href="https://slothytech.com/ip-ban/">reliable proxy</a>, configure your system’s network settings with the proxy details, and launch the game through the proxy IP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Switching Network Connection:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For PC:</strong> Switch between Ethernet and Wi-Fi, or disconnect and reconnect to your network to request a new IP from your ISP.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> VPNs are the easiest and most reliable option, though proxy servers work well for advanced users. Switching networks is simpler but less consistent since your ISP might reuse the same IP.</p>

<h3>2. Clearing Cache and Cookies</h3>
<p>Next, clear your browser’s cache and cookies to remove stored data that might still link your device to the ban, especially if you've used League’s web services like the forums or client login.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Open your browser settings, go to the privacy or history section, and select “Clear browsing data.”</li>
            <li>Check cookies, cached images, and files, then clear them.</li>
            <li>Restart the browser.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This step ensures no residual identifiers (like tracking cookies) flag your device, making it a critical follow-up to changing your IP.</p>

<h3>3. Uninstalling and Reinstalling</h3>
<p>Now, uninstall and reinstall League of Legends to reset any local configurations or data tied to the ban.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your control panel or settings, find League of Legends, and select “Uninstall.”</li>
            <li>Download and reinstall it from the official Riot Games website.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This wipes any game-specific data that might still trigger the ban, complementing the previous steps by starting fresh with your new IP.</p>

<h3>4. Changing MAC Address</h3>
<p>Finally, change your device’s Media Access Control (MAC) address to bypass any network-level blocks that might include MAC filtering alongside the IP ban.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For PC:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Change adapter options.</li>
            <li>Right-click your network adapter, select properties, go to “Client for Microsoft Networks,” and configure.</li>
            <li>Use an online tool to generate a new MAC address, input it into the “Value” box, and save.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing your MAC address adds an extra layer of identity masking. It’s not always required, but for persistent bans, it helps ensure you appear as a completely new user.</p>

<h2>How It Works Together</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1 (Changing IP):</strong> Hides your banned IP by giving you a new one.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2 (Clearing Cache and Cookies):</strong> Removes stored data that could still identify you.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3 (Uninstalling and Reinstalling):</strong> Resets the game client to a clean state.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4 (Changing MAC Address):</strong> Covers any additional network-level bans tied to your device’s hardware ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following all steps, you tackle the ban from multiple angles—network, client data, and hardware—making it harder for Riot Games to recognize you as the banned player.</p>

<h2>If You Are HWID Banned</h2>
<p>If you suspect you’re facing a Hardware ID (HWID) ban in League of Legends, which goes beyond just an IP ban, follow this additional guide. HWID bans target your device’s unique hardware identifiers, requiring more advanced steps to bypass.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Test after each step to see if access is restored, but complete all steps for persistent bans.</li>
    <li>Use a paid VPN or proxy for reliability, as free options might not work as well.</li>
    <li>Skip MAC address changes unless the IP ban persists after the earlier steps.</li>
    <li>Be aware that bypassing bans might violate Riot Games’ terms of service, so proceed responsibly.</li>
</ul>

<p>This method ensures a thorough approach, tailored for PC users, to get you back into League of Legends effectively.</p>
